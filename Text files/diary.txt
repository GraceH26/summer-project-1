Today, I started making my first website of the summer. I set up all the files I plan on editing and using for the site. I also 
pulled one of the old style sheets that I had already made and applied to the website until I get to editing it and customizing it. 
Speaking of customizing, I also decided upon a color pallette for the website. Right now it is in notes.txt. I'm really looking forward
to getting this website finsihed and added to my portfolio!! Here's the first day screenshot-
